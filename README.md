Just a fellow human, trying to automate science

* Former: Infectious disease laboratory scientist, devops engineer
* Current: Senior scientific computational engineer
* I like Kubernetes, and am working on becoming a kubestronaut
* I switched off of arch(btw) after 13+ years for nixos; Change is hard, but rewarding
* I run a very small homelab
